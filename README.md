Ran into some problems forking the original repo from rdpeng.  I just re-wrote the code from scratch and have his forked to a separate repo.  Sorry if that causes problems, but it didn't make sense to me to fork a bunch of images and his README.

Use the saved .dat file to load data, then the R code should work fine.  You may have to change the path.
